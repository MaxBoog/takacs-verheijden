In addition, the need to collaborate has increased significantly. And that means coordinating, exploring interests, setting priorities, asking colleagues for cooperation, making agreements and then sticking to those agreements. Working together also means: communicating clearly, confronting drivel, motivating people and setting boundaries.

            Academia knows no boundaries. Your research is never finished, and
            your teaching can always be Academic leadership: what does that
            entail? A career in science is very demanding. improved. At the same
            time the necessity to do research in teams and consortia has greatly
            increased. Leadership here focuses on exploring and aligning
            interests, on setting priorities, asking colleagues to cooperate.
            Collaboration also means communicating clearly, both confronting and
            motivating people and being clear about boundaries. <br /><br />
            Supervising and coaching scientists is a subtle art, and everyone
            can learn it - or become better at it.

                      Scientists are intrinsically very motivated to give their
                      best in education, research patient care. But sometimes
                      the best intentions have unintended and even disastrous
                      effects. Self-reflection, feedback, peer consultation, and
                      open communication are helpful to monitor and assess
                      yourself and thus create space for a safe environment for
                      both employees and students. Those in leadership positions
                      play a crucial role here.

                      Curious how others do it, how other faculties are
                      organized? How to manage without losing sight of your own
                      interests? For this type of questions and dilemma’s we
                      tailor leadership programs.

                      Our Academic Leadership program is a solid and personal
                      journey into the three main aspects of leadership:

                      <li>
                        Strategic: Doing the right things. What are your
                        ambitions, what goals do you want to achieve and how
                        will you stay focused?

                      <li>
                        Operational: Doing things right. How do you implement
                        your goals in everyday reality and how do you keep your
                        employees engaged and enthusiastic?
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Systemic: Influence the context. How do you read the
                        world outside? How do you involve your stakeholders and
                        make sure your have allies to support your plans?
                      </li>

                    <p>
                      The real questions and issues of our participants are
                      always central, complemented by directly applicable models
                      and theory. The course is offered either integral or
                      modular, depending on demand.

                    <p>
                      Intervision is a central tool in all our activities. Two
                      assumptions play an important role: every problem you face
                      also has a link with yourself, because someone else in
                      your position might not have it at all. And secondly:
                      every problem is embedded in a context. <br /><br />
                      Here's how it works: you explain your question or dilemma
                      to your colleague-participants. The external facilitator
                      uses a rather strict method to reveal the potential
                      question behind the question. Then, at some point, the
                      other participants express what they think might be the
                      real problem and what they would do in your place. Often
                      the other participants recognize your question – and
                      benefit themselves also from the whole process.
                      <br /><br />
                      Intervision promotes self-reflection. Often participants
                      find it liberating to realize that they are not alone in
                      dealing with questions and uncertainties. In Academia an
                      open and vulnerable expression of doubts was often
                      interpreted as weakness. In intervision, the common wisdom
                      of a group of people is catalyzed and exploited to the
                      full.

                      It can be very effective to discuss your questions and
                      dilemmas with someone who knows your world, but who does
                      not belong to it. A listening ear, a sounding board.
                      Someone to you can be completely open to, who will listen
                      without judgment. But who will also call a spade a spade
                      and may give you honest feedback or concrete advice for
                      your next steps. <br /><br />
                      Coaching often highlights very personal experiences and
                      beliefs that affect the professional development of a
                      person. A listening ear, but also someone who asks and
                      does not judge, can help to detect and face the real
                      issue. The meetings, face-to-face or online, are
                      completely confidential. A coaching program usually
                      consists of four or five sessions of one to one and a half
                      hours.

                      Our expertise is facilitating leadership as a process.
                      Scientists themselves have the content expertise and know
                      very well where they want to go. But how to get there?
                      With a team of highly intelligent and sometimes quite
                      stubborn colleagues for whom autonomy is crucial?

                      We can support you in several ways. As an outside sparring
                      partner, for instance. Together we design a plan and
                      discuss the next step as we go. The advantage is that you
                      are visible to the others as the one in charge. But we can
                      also facilitate one or several meetings, to help the team
                      to take new steps together. The advantage of this method
                      is that you can then participate in content yourself.
